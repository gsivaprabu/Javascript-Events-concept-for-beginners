# UNDERSTANDING EVENT REGISTRATION

- Javascript code runs sequentially.
- Events can trigger scripts.
- Browsers can trigger events.
- Events may happen at any time.
	- Page load
	- mouse over
	- click

### EVENT REGISTRATION

- Using tag attributes.

- Using dot notation.

- onclick method is not proper way you can segregated the scripts in outside of HTML tags

- use document.getElementById('idName').onclick

- In modern javascript we used addEventListener()

- We can check to allow multiple events.
